## Use the same database that we used in the lecture:
1. from “orderdetails” table. Write a query to get all order numbers (without repetition) that contain any product starting with code S18 and price more than 100.

2. from “payments” table. Write a query to get all payments that were made on day 5 or 6 (whatever month or year).

3. from “customers” table. Write a query to get the fifth-highest credit limit of the customers who (live in the USA and their phone number contains 5555).

## Notice: 
1. save the three queries that you wrote in a SQL file “queries.sql”.
2. put queries.sql into your repo folder.
3. push the repo to Github.
